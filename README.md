# OpenTok One-to-One Communication Sample Apps<br/>Version 1.0

This is where you can explore the OpenTok sample apps! These samples include the use of accelerator packs, available from your TokBox representative, which you can use to quickly and easily develop powerful OpenTok applications. 

All of the sample apps are based on the the OpenTok One-to-One Communication Sample App, which is an open-source solution that enables you to quickly get started in your development efforts to set up interoperable, production-quality audio/video communication between users. 

  - **[One-to-One Communication Sample App](./one-to-one-sample-app)**: Begin by exploring this sample app, and learn the best practices used to develop and manage the audio, video, and camera elements on mobile devices or in the browser. 

_**NOTE: The audio-video communication logic provided in all OpenTok One-to-One Communication Sample Apps is contained in the [OpenTok Common Accelerator Session Pack](https://github.com/opentok/acc-pack-common)._
