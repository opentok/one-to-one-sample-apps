# OpenTok One-to-One Communication Sample App for Android<br/>Version 1.2

## Quick start

This section shows you how to prepare, build, and run the sample application.

### Install the project files

1. Clone the [OpenTok One-to-One Communication Sample App for Android repository](https://github.com/opentok/one-to-one-sample-apps/tree/master/one-to-one-sample-app/android) from GitHub.
1. Start Android Studio.
1. In the **Quick Start** panel, click **Open an existing Android Studio Project**.
1. Navigate to the **android** folder, select the **OnetoOneSample** folder, and click **Choose**.


### Add the OpenTok SDK

There are two options for installing the OpenTok SDK  included in the Accelerator Pack Common for Android:


#### Using the repository

1. Clone the [OpenTok Accelerator Pack repo](https://github.com/opentok/acc-pack-common).
2. From your app project, right-click the app name and select **New > Module > Import Gradle Project**.
3. Navigate to the directory in which you cloned **OpenTok Accelerator Pack**, select **android-accelerator-pack**, and click **Finish**.
4. Open the **build.gradle** file for the app and ensure the following lines have been added to the `dependencies` section:

```
compile project(':android-accelerator-pack')

```

#### Using Maven

1. Modify the `build.gradle` for your solution and add the following code snippet to the section labeled `repositories`:

    ```gradle
    maven { url  "http://tokbox.bintray.com/maven" }
    ```

1. Modify the `build.gradle` for your activity and add the following code snippet to the section labeled `dependencies`:

```gradle
compile 'com.opentok.android:accelerator-pack:1.1.0'
```
### Configure and build the app

Configure the sample app code. Then, build and run the app.

1. Get values for **API Key**, **Session ID**, and **Token**. See [OpenTok One-to-One Communication Sample App home page](../README.md) for important information.

In Android Studio, open **OpenTokConfig.java** and replace the following empty strings with the corresponding **API Key**, **Session ID**, and **Token** values:

   ```java
    // Replace with a generated Session ID
    public static final String SESSION_ID = "";

    // Replace with a generated token
    public static final String TOKEN = "";

    // Replace with your OpenTok API key
    public static final String API_KEY = "";
   ```

   ### Optional: Manage Annotations from Other Clients

   By default, your app receives annotations from other clients that have the same session ID. This feature is controlled by the following line of code open **OpenTokConfig.java**.

   ```java
   public static final boolean SUBSCRIBE_TO_SELF = false;
   ```

   To enable or disable the `SUBSCRIBE_TO_SELF` feature, you can invoke the `OneToOneCommunication.setSubscribeToSelf()` method:

   ```java
   OneToOneCommunication comm = new OneToOneCommunication(
     MainActivity.this,
     OpenTokConfig.SESSION_ID,
     OpenTokConfig.TOKEN,
     OpenTokConfig.API_KEY
   );

   comm.setSubscribeToSelf(OpenTokConfig.SUBSCRIBE_TO_SELF);

   ```


## Exploring the code

This section describes best practices the sample app code uses to implement the one-to-one communication features.

For detail about the APIs used to develop this sample, see the [OpenTok Android SDK Reference](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/android/reference/) and [Android API Reference](http://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html).

_**NOTE:** This sample app collects anonymous usage data for internal TokBox purposes only. Please do not modify or remove any logging code from this sample application._

### Class design

This section focuses on one-to-one communication features. For more information, see the [OpenTok One-to-One Communication Sample App](https://github.com/opentok/one-to-one-sample-apps).

| Class        | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `MainActivity`    | Implements the UI and media control callbacks. |
| `OpenTokConfig`   | Stores the information required to configure the session and authorize the app to make requests to the backend server.   |
| `PreviewControlFragment`   | Manages the toolbar for the local audio and video controls, and the start/end call button. |
| `RemoteControlFragment`   | Manages the icons to enable/disable the audio and video of the remote subscriber. |
| `PreviewCameraFragment `   | Manages the camera control. |


### Session and stream management

The `OneToOneCommunication` class, included in the Accelerator Pack Common for Android, is the backbone of the one-to-one communication features for the app.

This class uses the OpenTok API to initiate the client connection to the OpenTok session and manage the audio and video streams.

```java
public class OneToOneCommunication implements
        Session.SessionListener,
        Publisher.PublisherListener,
        Subscriber.SubscriberListener,
        Subscriber.VideoListener {
   . . .
}
```

#### Interfaces implemented by the class

The `OneToOneCommunication` class implements the interfaces described in the following table. See their descriptions in the [OpenTok Android SDK Reference](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/android/reference/) for information about the methods required to implement them.


| Interface        | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [`Session.SessionListener`](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/android/reference/com/opentok/android/Session.SessionListener.html)   | Monitors session state, handling client connections and stream events. |
| [`Publisher.PublisherListener`](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/android/reference/com/opentok/android/PublisherKit.PublisherListener.html)      | Monitors publisher stream events.  |
| [`Subscriber.SubscriberListener`](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/android/reference/com/opentok/android/SubscriberKit.SubscriberListener.html) | Monitors subscriber events.  |
| [`Subscriber.VideoListener`](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/android/reference/com/opentok/android/SubscriberKit.VideoListener.html) | Monitors subscriber video events.  |


#### Methods

The following `OneToOneCommunication` methods are used for session and stream management, and in most cases are required by the interfaces implemented by the class.

| Feature        | Methods  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Manage the session, publisher and subscriber.   | `start()`, `end()`,  `init()`, `destroy()`, `isStarted()`, `isRemote()`, `isInitialized()`, `isScreensharing()`, `setRemoteFill()`, `getLocal()`, `getRemote()`, `setSubscribeToSelf()` |
| Manage audio events.              | `getLocalAudio()`, `getRemoteAudio()` |
| Manage video events.              | `getLocalVideo()`, `getRemoteVideo()` |
| Manage camera events.              | `swapCamera()`, `getCameraId()` |
| Manage views              | `reloadViews()`, `getRemoteVideoView()`, `getRemoteScreenView()`, `getPreviewView()`  |


The Listener interface monitors state changes in the OneToOneCommunication, and defines the following methods:

```java
      public static interface Listener {
        void onInitialized();
        void onError(String error);
        void onQualityWarning(boolean warning);
        void onAudioOnly(boolean enabled);
        void onPreviewReady(View preview);
        void onRemoteViewReady(View remoteView);
        void onReconnecting();
        void onReconnected();
        void onCameraChanged(int newCameraId);
    }
````

### User interface

As described in [Class design](#class-design), the following classes set up and manage the UI fragments for the local and remote controls:

   - `PreviewControlFragment`
   - `RemoteControlFragment`
   - `PreviewCameraFragment`


These classes work with the following `MainActivity` methods, which manage the views as the publisher and subscriber participate in the session.

| Feature        | Methods  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Manage the UI containers. | `onCreate()`  |
| Reload the UI views whenever the device [configuration](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html), such as screen size or orientation, changes. | `onConfigurationChanged()`  |
| Manage the UI for local and remote controls. | `onDisableLocalAudio()`, `onDisableLocalVideo()`, `onCall()`, `onDisableRemoteAudio()`, `onDisableRemoteVideo()`, `showRemoteControlBar()`, `onCameraSwap()` |

You can also create custom UI responses to OpenTok events fired in your implementation of the `OneToOneCommunication.Listener` interface. For example, if a communication error occurs, you can develop and display a custom alert in the `MainActivity` class.



### Audio, video, camera

The following `OneToOneCommunication` methods are used to manage the local and remote media devices.

| Feature        | Methods  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|  Enable and disable local audio and video.  | `enableLocalMedia(MediaType, boolean)`<br/> `MediaType ` is `AUDIO` or `VIDEO`<br/>`true` (enabled) or `false` (disabled) |
|  Enable and disable remote audio and video.  | `enableRemoteMedia(MediaType, boolean)`<br/> `MediaType ` is `AUDIO` or `VIDEO`<br/>`true` (enabled) or `false` (disabled) |
|  Swap between multiple cameras on a device (normal and selfie modes).  | `swapCamera()` |
