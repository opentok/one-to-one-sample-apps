# OpenTok One-to-One Communication Sample App for iOS<br/>Version 1.1

This document describes how to use the OpenTok One-to-One Communication Sample App for iOS. You will learn best practices for managing the audio, video, and camera elements on an iOS mobile device. We recommend this is as your first step in delivering interoperable, production-quality audio/video solutions on the OpenTok platform. 

You can configure and run this sample app within just a few minutes!


This guide has the following sections:

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites): A checklist of everything you need to get started.
* [Quick start](#quick-start): A step-by-step tutorial to help you quickly import and run the sample app.
* [Exploring the code](#exploring-the-code): This describes the sample app code design, which uses recommended best practices to implement the one-to-one communication features. 

## Prerequisites

To be prepared to develop your one-to-one communication app:

1. Xcode version 5 or later.
2. Review the [OpenTok iOS SDK Requirements](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/ios/).
3. Your app will need a **Session ID**, **Token**, and **API Key**, which you can get at the [OpenTok Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.tokbox.com/).

_**NOTE**: The OpenTok Developer Dashboard allows you to quickly run this sample program. For production deployment, you must generate the **Session ID** and **Token** values using one of the [OpenTok Server SDKs](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/server/)._

## Quick start

To get up and running quickly with your app, go through the following steps in the tutorial provided below:

### Using CocoaPods
1. In a terminal prompt, navigate into your project directory and type `pod install`.
2. Reopen your project using the new *.xcworkspace file.

For more information about CocoaPods, including installation instructions, visit [CocoaPods Getting Started](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

### Configuring the app
Now you are ready to add the configuration detail to your app. These will include the **Session ID**, **Token**, and **API Key** you retrieved earlier (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).

In **AppDelegate.m**, replace the following empty strings with the required detail:


   ```objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

    // Override point for customization after application launch.    
    [OneToOneCommunicator setOpenTokApiKey:@""
                                 sessionId:@""
                                     token:@""];
    return YES;
}
   ```

_At this point you can try running the app! You can either use a simulator or an actual mobile device._

## Exploring the code

This section describes how the sample app code design uses recommended best practices to implement the one-to-one communication features. 

For detail about the APIs used to develop this sample, see the [OpenTok iOS SDK Reference](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/ios/reference/).

  - [Class design](#class-design)
  - [Session and stream management](#session-and-stream-management)
  - [View Controllers](#view-controllers)
  - [User interface](#user-interface)

_**NOTE:** The sample app contains logic used for logging. This is used to submit anonymous usage data for internal TokBox purposes only. We request that you do not modify or remove any logging code in your use of this sample application._

### Class design

The following classes represent the software design for this sample app.

| Class        | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `OneToOneCommunicator`   | Uses the OpenTok API to initiate the client connection to the OpenTok session, and manages the audio and video stream subscriptions.  |
| `MainViewController`   | <br/>In conjunction with **Main.storyboard**, this class implements the UI and its responses to all events associated with actions for the local and remote audio and video controls, the publisher’s start/end call button, and the publisher’s camera position (forward or selfie mode).   |
| `MainView`  | Defines the main user interfaces of the sample app, and contains the logic for styling and transitioning for the user interfaces. <br/> |


### Session and stream management

The `OneToOneCommunicator` class is the backbone of the one-to-one communication features for the app. 

This class conforms to the protocols that initiate the client connection to the OpenTok session and sets up the listeners for the publisher and subscriber streams:

```objc
@interface OneToOneCommunicator : NSObject
```

#### Protocol conformance and implementation

The OpenTok protocols to which the `OneToOneCommunicator` class conforms in its internally defined implementation are described in the following table. See their descriptions in the [OpenTok iOS SDK Reference](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/ios/reference/) for information about the methods required to implement them. 


| Protocol        | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [`OTSessionDelegate`](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/android/reference/com/opentok/android/Session.SessionListener.html)   | Monitors session state, handling client connections and stream events. |
| [`OTSubscriberKitDelegate`](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/ios/reference/Protocols/OTSubscriberKitDelegate.html)      | Monitors subscriber events.  |
| [`OTPublisherDelegate`](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/ios/reference/Protocols/OTPublisherDelegate.html) | Monitors publisher stream events and changes to the camera position.  |


#### Methods

The following `OneToOneCommunicator` methods are used for session and stream management, and in most cases are required by the protocols to which the class conforms.

| Feature        | Methods  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Manage the publisher and subscriber instances, start and end session connections, signal events.   | `connectWithHandler`, `disconnect`|
| Manage the subscription streams.      | `streamCreated`, `streamDestroyed` |
| Respond to subscriber connection events. | `subscriberDidConnectToStream`  |
| Store configuration information across the app | `oneToOneCommunicator` |
| Set configuration information | `setOpenTokApiKey` |


The following enum notifies the main controller of all session, publisher, and subscriber events:

```objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSUInteger, OneToOneCommunicationSignal) {
    OneToOneCommunicationSignalSessionDidConnect = 0,
    OneToOneCommunicationSignalSessionDidDisconnect,
    OneToOneCommunicationSignalSessionDidFail,
    OneToOneCommunicationSignalSessionStreamCreated,
    OneToOneCommunicationSignalSessionStreamDestroyed,
    OneToOneCommunicationSignalPublisherDidFail,
    OneToOneCommunicationSignalSubscriberConnect,
    OneToOneCommunicationSignalSubscriberDidFail,
    OneToOneCommunicationSignalSubscriberVideoDisabled,
    OneToOneCommunicationSignalSubscriberVideoEnabled,
    OneToOneCommunicationSignalSubscriberVideoDisableWarning,
    OneToOneCommunicationSignalSubscriberVideoDisableWarningLifted,
};
```

### View Controllers

As described in [Class design](#class-design), the `MainViewController` class, in conjunction with **Main.storyboard**, receives notifications from the `OneToOneCommunicator` class and manages the UI responses to media usage events, which are associated with actions for the local and remote audio and video controls, the publisher’s start/end call button, and the publisher’s camera position (forward or selfie mode).

| Feature       | Methods       |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Subscriber audio.   | `subscriberAudioButtonPressed` |
| Subscriber video.   | `subscriberVideoButtonPressed`  |
| Publisher audio.      | `publisherMicrophoneButtonPressed`  |
| Publisher start and end call. | `publisherCallButtonPressed `  |
| Publisher video. | `publisherVideoButtonPressed`  |
| Publisher camera orientation (forward or selfie mode). | `publisherCameraButtonPressed`  |
